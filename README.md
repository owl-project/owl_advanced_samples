# Advanced Samples for OWL

This repository contains some additional samples for the OWL "OptiX
Wrappers Library" project (hosted on https://github.com/NVIDIA/owl).

The samples inside this repository initially started out as part of
OWL itself, but building them requires additional tools like GLFW, the
owlViewer interactive viewer tool, etc, to be able to open windows and
let the user interact with the respective sample. In order to make OWL
lose all these dependencies and all this extra "weight"--and to
streamline it into just the base OWL library itself--I decided to
strip those off an move those to a separate repository.

# Contributors
 
In the process of splitting these samples off the original OWL project
all of github's contributor tracking got lost, so just to make sure
this doesn't get lost: There's a whole bunch of people that have
helped with building OWL and these samples - amongst them, in the hope
that I'm not forgetting too many of them - some of the most important
contributors were:

- Nate Morrical, University of Utah, then NVIDIA
- Dylan Lacewell, NVIDIA
- Will Usher, University of Utah, now Luminary Cloud
- Stefan Zellmann, University of Cologne
- Jeff Amstutz, NVIDIA

(if I forgot anybody, please send me a ping, or even better, a PR)
